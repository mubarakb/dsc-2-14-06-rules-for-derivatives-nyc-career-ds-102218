    "In this section, we learned a different way for calculating the derivative.  The derivative of a function at a given point is still the instantaneous rate of change of that function at that point. Now we have three rules that allow us to calculate our derivative.  The most tricky of these is the power rule, which says that if $f(x) = x^r$, then $ f'(x) = r * x^{r-1} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our derivative rules, we can now calculate the derivative across the entire function.  So the derivative of $f(x) = 6x $ is always 6, and the derivative of $f(x) = x^2 $ is $f(x) = 2x $.  To evaluate our derivative at a specific value of $x$, we simply plug that value of $x$ into our derivative.  When $f'(x) = 2x$, then $f'(2) = 2*2$.  "
